I've always been interested in the computing field. During my early years I went to university to study web design and Business Information Technology. Both of these areas were compelling to me but as time went on I lost alot of interest in a lot of aspects of these subjects. I've since worked many part time jobs including junior poisitions for IT companies and even participated in free lance projects.

My interests and goals have changed a lot in the past few years and its time for new targets and goals. I think learning a new language is always a very interesting thing to do and Ruby is something i'm not familiar with so its going to be a challenge.

Software Engineering offers a new challenge one that i'm looking forward to and with my general background in It. i'm excited to learn new skills and try and obtain a career in this field. Programming has always been a difficult but very rewarding field of study and its one I'm looking forward to progressing in.
